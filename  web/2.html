 Internal strife is continuing at the minor opposition Bareunmirae Party(BP) as its new floor leader and some supreme council members are pressuring the party chairman to resign.

 Rep. Oh Shin-hwan, who was elected as BP floor leader on Wednesday, said at the supreme council meeting on Friday that Chairman Sohn Hak-kyu should resign to save the party.

 Some supreme council members including Rep. Ha Tae-keung also demanded Sohn's resignation. Ha said that the election of the new floor leader equals non-confidence in regards to the chairman.

 The party's supreme council member Moon Byung-ho, meanwhile, said that they should not pressure Sohn for his resignation since the chairman is elected by party members, not lawmakers.

 Sohn made it clear that he will not resign. He told reporters after the meeting that it is his task to save the party and lead it to victory at the general election.

 The party has been in internal strife over whether to place some reform bills on a fast-track at the National Assembly.
